# Zettlr Custom CSS

My personal custom CSS for [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com) to make the text editor look a little bit more like iA Writer. 

However, since the newer Versions of Zettlr really do look so beautiful, I stripped down my custom CSS to just a few basic things:

- Font
- The same size for text and headings
- Neutral grey background color
- End-of-paragraph marker

Looks best with the _Berlin_ theme, Adapts to dark and light mode.

Should at least work with the macOS and Windows versions.

**Please note:** There are two version â€” one for Zettlr up to version 2.3, and one for the new version 3.

## How to use

1. Open Zettlr.
2. Switch to **Berlin** theme
2. Go to **Zettlr > Assets Manager**
3. Switch to **Custom CSS**
4. Paste the CSS source code
