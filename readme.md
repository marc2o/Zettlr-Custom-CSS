# Zettlr Custom CSS

![Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marc2o/Zettlr-Custom-CSS/main/screenshot.png)
My personal custom CSS for [Zettlr](https://zettlr.com), »a markdown editor for the 21st century«, (macOS, not tested on other platforms). Looks best with the themes _Berlin_, _Bielefeld_ and _Karl-Marx-Stadt_. Adapts to dark and light mode.

Should at least work with the macOS and Windows versions.

## How to use

1. Open Zettlr.
2. Go to **Zettlr > Assets Manager**
3. Switch to **Custom CSS**
4. Paste the CSS source code
